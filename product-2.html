        Absolutely amazed that my 4 dogs have not destroyed this!!! Any other toys have been destroyed within 12 hours -
        can't even leave a ball out as they rip it to shreds! This toy is going strong 3 months later and the dogs
        absolutely love it!!! The best dog toy I have ever bought - I've just ordered another one so my 2 crazy chewers
        can have one each!!!

        Absolutely brilliant ball. My jack Russell destroyed tennis balls in a minute but,its now after new year and he
        hasn't managed to get his teeth into it yet. RESULT!!!!!

        Nice and sturdy as my dog will destroy most things. Noisy squeaker which she loves ❤️ happy dog, happy life !

      <li>First toy that has not been destroyed in 10 minutes. Exceptional quality if your dog is a chewer!</li>

        Two years later, this is still my dog's favourite toy. It's his comfort blanket, plaything and stress reliever.
        It stopped squeaking after about a year, but still seems infinitely chewable!
