        Only lasted 5 days! I spent a bit more on this thinking it might last a few weeks - other toys were less than a
        fiver as I expect them to not last too long! It seems a cockapoo is more dangerous to ducks than I thought!!

        It looked like a nice enough toy but unfortunately started coming apart, with relatively gentle play, pretty
        quickly. Both wings came off first, and the fabric frayed badly around the torn areas and seams. I'm
        disappointed with the quality overall.
