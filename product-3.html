        liked this a lot. I use when leaving puppy alone for short periods keeps him happy trying to get all the treats

        Great quality and well made. Has Bell inside. Wouldn't put food tho as a nightmare to clean. More suitable for
        bigger dogs- our terrier finds it too big and lost interest quick. When thrown it bounces unexpectedly- big
        plus. Would buy it if there was a smaller version of the same. All in all better for a bigger dog.

      <li>Very good quality</li>
      <li>
        Holes are very small could not find any treats small enough to put in so cut some bits up to put in but my dog
        got fed up with toy as bits got stuck in holes also crumbs all over floor
      </li>
      <li>
        Treats that fit through the tiny holes simply fall out of the MANY holes as it roles. Not really any effort from
        puppy. Can't add larger treats as holes tiny. Useless waste of time. He got bored within the day of this one at
        9 weeks old. No challenge. Waste of cash!!!
