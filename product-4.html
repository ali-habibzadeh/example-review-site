        It's small but my dog loves it, hasn't popped a hole in it yet and he's had it for a while. Lovely colour and
        design

        Very durable- I have two young staffs and not many toys that are described as durable last long normally but
        this has.

        I bought this toy for my parents' labrador, who is known for his likes and dislikes on his toys. Although he is
        10 years old he still chooses his toys like a toddler and this one has become his fan favourite. He will burrow
        to the bottom of his play basket to hear a hoot off this extremely slobbered friend and will bound about the
        house with glee once caught. Although it has been almost 2 months since his Xmas present he still unearths the
        rest of his toy box to find his favourite parrot. I'm calling this an A* on Lab toys. Good for big dogs
        recommended.
